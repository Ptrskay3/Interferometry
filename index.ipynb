    "## PySprint - Spectrally resolved interferometry in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "PySprint package is an open source Python package dedicated to evaluate measurements relying on spectrally and spatially resolved interferometry. The package aims to provide a fluent and smooth interface which takes away the burden of managing complex data processing tasks, however it can hand over the full control to the user when necessary. PySprint is integrated well in Jupyter Notebooks with rich inline HTML representations of objects. In the future there will be graphical interfaces added for the Jupyter Notebook using the [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. \n",
