# Contributing to Interferometry

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible about your
operating system, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PyQt5 version and python version. Whenever possible,
please also include a brief, self-contained code/screenshot example that demonstrates the problem.


## Contributing code 

Thanks for your interest in contributing code to Interferometry!

This repository is strongly connected to my thesis, and to avoid any kind of copyright issues contributing is temporaly rejected.
Later on - when it's released - contributing will be available.
